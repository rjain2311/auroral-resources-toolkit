## This Toolkit is... ##

  * An interface to a variety of aurora centric time-series, imagery, and geospatial data and metadata
  * A collaboration between the [NOAA National Geophysical Data Center](http://ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/) and [The Russian Academy of Science's Geophysical Center](http://www.gcras.ru/lab2_r.htm)
  * Powered by SPIDR web services [(Space Physics Interactive Data Resource)](http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/)
  * A [Qooxdoo/Javascript](http://qooxdoo.org/) based BUI (browser user interface) that utilizes a variety of NGDC web services, as well as several external sources, including [NASA](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/) and [LASP (Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics)](http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/).

## Project Organization ##
The RAS team, owing to their extensive GIS and back end experience played a major
role on those aspects of the project. The NGDC team therefore focused on the science
driving the project, and the user interface and web services to support it. This project
is the culmination of several collaborative projects between NGDC and RAS, and builds
on much of the previous work to show what's possible with SPIDR's web services.
